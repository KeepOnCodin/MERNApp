# MERN Starter Application


**This is a starter app for a MERN stack application with authentication. This is for a SPA (Single Page Application) workflow that uses the Vite Build tool:**
> - Allow users to register
> - Allow users to logout
> - Allow users to update their profile


## Technologies Used:
> - Node.js
> - Git and GitHub
> - Express.js
> - MongoDB
> - React

#### More specifically I learned how to:
> - Build a Backend API with Express & MongoDB
> - Routes for auth, logout, register, profile, update profile
> - JWT authentication stored in HTTP-only cookie
> - Protect routes and endpoints
> - Create custom middleware to check JSON web tokens and store them in a cookie
> - React frontend to register, login, logout, view profile, and update profile
> - React Bootstrap UI library
> - React Toastify notifications

Upcoming Projects:
- Reddit Client(React.js/Redux Application).
- Pomodoro Application
